                As part of my Computing in the Classroom module, which had me on a placement at West Calder High School between October 2017 and February 2018, I carried out a personal project, which I will write a report on for
                30% of my grade.  The nature of this project meant that I was flexible to do whatever I liked in the school, as long as it involved me taking the lead in some way.
              </p>
              <p align="left">
                I decided to teach the third year class that I was working with how to create iOS and Android mobile applications using an online application called
                '<a target="_blank" href="https://thunkable.com/#/">Thunkable</a>'.  Originally, I had planned to use <a target="_blank" href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a>, but this proved too
                impractical as the school's network firewall has been configured to block QR codes (the main way to demo your apps on App Inventor).
                Thunkable, like App Inventor, is a block-programming environment.  This means you can write programs using coloured blocks and you can
                design your interface by dragging and dropping components.  I decided this would be ideal for my personal project as I thought that
                the class, which had a mixed level of abilities, would take to this quickly after dealing with the 'Scratch' block-programming environment
                before.  It also meant they could have the satisfaction of having real running apps in their hand that they had created themselves, and they
                could get them running very quickly using the 'Thunkable Live' function.  The whole idea was to make the three lessons I took as interesting and as fun as possible.
              </p>
              <p align="left">
                Further to this, Thunkable is available online, so it is not difficult to get access to.  All the pupils needed was internet access
                and a Google account.  They could even access it from home!  I tried to encourage them to take the initiative to work from home as much
                as possible and a few of the pupils did just that.
              </p>
              <p align="left">
                My project lasted for three days, with each 'day' being a 50 minute lesson, and it ran as follows:
              </p>
              <p align="left">
                • Day 1: Introductory slides and worksheet 1, which involved carrying out some introductory tutorials.
              </p>
              <p align="left">
                • Day 2: Worksheet 2, which involved extending the apps they made the previous day.
              </p>
              <p align="left">
                • Day 3: Worksheet 3, which involved coming up with their own ideas and creating
                  their own apps from scratch.
              </p>
              <p align="left">
                 The idea was to initially give the class complete instructions on how to complete the tasks, and to gradually work
                 to a stage where they were in control of the work themselves.  I tried to encourage experimentation with the different
                 features of Thunkable, and tried to get them to be as creative as possible.  The class seemed to have a lot of fun
                 and I am hoping they now see the fun side of programming if they didn't before.
