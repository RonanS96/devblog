          Worked in a group of 5, which later dropped to 4, to produce a database for
          a fictional parcel delivery company.  This had to be done from scratch, i.e
          we had to come up with our own scenario and conceptual model, then had to come
          up with a relational schema before implementing it in MySQL.  We also came up
          with test data to populate the database, queries and indexes to improve efficiency.
          The final stage of this coursework was to connect it to a Java application which
          had to access the database securely and without risk of SQL injection.

          This coursework assignment involved using the graph data structure to store
          information about airports and the costs to fly between them.  A user could then
          enter which airports they wanted to fly between and the program would use
          Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest (cheapest cost) path.  It was also intelligent enough to
          choose a path through multiple airports if that was the cheapest option.

          This assignment involved writing an SML program to translate between the regular
          lambda calculus and another form called item lambda calculus notation.  We were
          given some starter code but had to change it to work with item notation as well
          as regular notation and we were given a long list of tests to carry out on our solution
          also.

          done individually.  It involved creating an Android app for mobile phones using
          the online application MIT App Inventor, which uses block programming. We later worked
          on a currency converter app in Java using the Eclipse IDE.

          a number of different design diagrams including use case, sequence, class, activity
          and state-machine diagrams.  We also had to outline the functional and non-functional
          requirements of the system.
