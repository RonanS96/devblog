          Worked in a group of 5, which later dropped to 4, to produce a database for
          a fictional parcel delivery company.  This had to be done from scratch, i.e
          we had to come up with our own scenario and conceptual model, then had to come
          up with a relational schema before implementing it in MySQL.  We also came up
          with test data to populate the database, queries and indexes to improve efficiency.
          The final stage of this coursework was to connect it to a Java application which
          had to access the database securely and without risk of SQL injection.

          This coursework assignment involved using the graph data structure to store
          information about airports and the costs to fly between them.  A user could then
          enter which airports they wanted to fly between and the program would use
          Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest (cheapest cost) path.  It was also intelligent enough to
          choose a path through multiple airports if that was the cheapest option.
