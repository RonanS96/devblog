            <p align="left">
              In June 2018 I was asked by Jill Ritchie to assist her in the creation of a website to advertise and provide
              information about her up and coming life coaching business. I was pretty much given free reign on how the website was
              set up with only small amounts of information being provided to me (e.g. colour scheme, content) so it has been a fun project for
              me to work on. The 'client' in this case did, however, ask if it could be built using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> - an online website builder
              similar to Wix. I was slightly sceptical of Squarespace as I had only really used standard HTML, CSS, PHP, ... for web development and so I was worried that it would be very
              clunky and restricting, but I decided to give it a go anyway.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              The website contains lots of information about Jill and her work, including client testimonials, an about me section with her story
              and a blog. The website also contains links to her social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn) and a link to sign
              users up to her mail list. The mail list was created using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leadpages.net/">LeadPages</a> and <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/">ActiveCampaign</a>
              - two more tools I had never used before. Both these tools and Squarespace were extremely easy to get started with and very intuitive to
              use.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              Although I describe this as a 'fun' project it was also great experience for me as I had to approach it with a professional attitude.
              I met with the client on two occasions to discuss what was needing to be done and made sure I kept in touch with her every day that
              noticable changes had been made. I was also constantly in touch to make sure that the product was still sticking to the clients' requirements.
              In addition I had to write up privacy and cookie poloicies for the site, which involved looking into GDPR in more detail to make sure
              that all the important points were covered in these policies.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              I mentioned that I thought Squarespace might be clunky and restricting, but I would like to confirm that this was <b>not</b> the case.
              I was actually really happy with how well it worked and I think it is a great tool for web development. Almost everything in terms of
              set up is done (more or less) automatically, for example an SSL certificate was included, and the domain name could be easily set up.
              Pages could even be locked with a password easily to hide them during development.
              There were some restrictions that were forced by the template used (in my case "Bedford" template), for example it wouldn't let certain blocks take up 100% width on the
              screen. These restrictions were often little nippy problems like the one I've just mentioned and could usually be overcome using HTML code injection.
              This is a feature I liked about Squarespace - CSS and HTML injection - as they allow you much more freedom in the style and structure you
              want to go with.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              To summarise, I would say that I have very much enjoyed working with Squarespace and it's a tool I would use again.
              My opinion on these online-automatic-web-building platforms has definitely changed for the better and I would recommend them
              to anyone, especially beginners in web development. I am finished working on this project for now but may return to it in
              the future.
