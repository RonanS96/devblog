            <p align="left">
              In May 2018 I was asked by Jill Ritchie to assist her in the creation of a website to advertise and provide
              information on her up and coming life coaching business. I have pretty much been given free reign on how the website is
              set up with only small amounts of information being provided to me (e.g. colour scheme, content) so it has been a fun project for
              me to work on. The 'client' in this case did, however, ask if it could be built using Squarespace - an online website builder
              similar to Wix. I had never used this tool before but decided to give it a go.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              The website contains lots of information about Jill and her work, including client testimonials. It also provides options to
              sign up to her newsletter, or to book in a 15 minute discovery call with her and links to her social media accounts.
              Squarespace is, in my opinion, a fantastic tool as it does many things automatically and it is very easy to work with once
              you get started.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              Although I describe this as a 'fun' project it is also great experience for me as I am required to act very professional
              in communication with the client and creation of the site itself. I am also having to find out more about GDPR and will
              be creating a privacy policy for the site. I will also be dealing with a number of other new technologies and will include descriptions
              of all those on this page when the project is completed.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              The website is currently still under construction but you will see that the domain has already been set up.
