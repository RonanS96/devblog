              Emma Watt Art is a website that I have created to show off the work of a contemporary artist and friend of mine named Emma Watt.
              The design of the website is to be professional as well as being simple and easy to navigate.  It has been also been created using RWD
              (Responsive Web Design) meaning it will adjust and render differently depending on the display it is being shown on (mobile, PC monitor, tablet).
              To get started I have used a w3 Schools template and adjusted it accordingly.  Furthermore, it is currently a static website, but I would like
              to get it linked up to a database to allow for dynamic updating as well as allowing Emma to update the content of the site herself through
              a user interface.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              As requested by the artist the website has a landing page, which is displayed to the user before entering the website itself.  Upon entering the website
              the user is then directed to the home page, which displays an overview of some of the artwork as well as links to other parts of the site through a navigation
              bar, which is consistent accross the whole site.  Other areas of the website include the portfolio, which provides links to all of the artwork which is split into
              photography, mixed media, printmaking and commissioned drawings.  And inside each section you can see a description of each piece of work as well as the option
              to view an image in full size.  There is also an 'about' page where the artist herself is described and there is an option to contact her through email.
