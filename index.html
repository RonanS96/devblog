          Yesterday morning I attented my first event with STEM East and the STEM Ambassadors. It was
          a networking event at Currie Community High School that allowed 3rd year pupils to speak to
          people involved in STEM subjects at work or university and ask us questions to find out more
          information including the skills they needed for particular areas of work or study.  It was a
          successful morning for me and I enjoyed meeting with the young students, finding out what they
          are interested in and answering their questions.
