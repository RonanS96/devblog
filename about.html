    <p class="info">Hello visitor,</p>
    <p class="info">My name is Ronan Smith, and I am an undergraduate student, studying BSc Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University.
       I have just completed my third year of studies and hope to graduate in 2018.  I have a passion for computing and
       technology and enjoy the challenge of my course.  I am a positive, hardworking individual and outside of university I like to keep myself busy.
       In my spare time I like to keep fit by going to the gym and playing 5-a-side football.
       I enjoy socialising with friends, visiting new places and experiencing new situations in general.
       Currently I am working part-time in a local pub but I am interested in developing my working career in
       a more technology based area.</p>
    <p class="info">I am currently on a summer break from university and after having no luck in gaining relevant work through an
       internship or summer placement, I have decided that I will use my summer to work on some personal projects, one
       of which is this 'development blog'.  I plan to use this blog to help make people aware of the work I have been doing in and out of university
       and have included lots of information about coursework projects I have undertaken.  Due to strict university rules about sharing coursework
       with other students I will not be making my source code available on this site, but can happily show evidence of my work if required.  
       If you wish to contact me please do so on my academic email address shown below:</p>
