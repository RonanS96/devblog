          In this module we explored complex data structures and algorithms that are used in
          core areas of computer science. We learned the theory behind heaps, stacks, queues,
          priority queues, trees and graphs before implementing them in labs.  The coursework
          involved creating a system (in Java) which stored airports and the flight time between
          them in a weighted graph. The user could then input where they wanted to fly to and
          where they were flying from, which then prompted the system to find the shortest flying
          time, possibly in multiple flights, between the two airports. The program used Dijkstra's
          algorithm to do this.

          In this class we were taught about HCI - Human Computer Interaction - and learned
          how to design software is easy to use and understand.  We learned about ways users
          use software and how to design it in ways that satisfy the user (e.g 'Don't make me think!').
          We carried out a group project where we had to design our own product and test it
          through a usability study at an expo.

          In Programming Languages, we worked with three different languages (and paradigms),
          SML New-Jersey (functional), Prolog (logical) and Python (imperative).  The idea was
          to explore the differences between them in terms of memory management, variables, and
          how they work in general.  We worked on practical labs throughout the semester to test
          and develop our knowledge.

          Web programming discussed the different languages available for creating web
          sites and web applications.  We were taught some theory about HTML5, XHTML, CSS 3, JavaScript,
          JQuery and Ajax, CakePHP and JSON. We used PHPMyAdmin to create a database to store tweets from news pages
          on Twitter and had a website which displayed the information in a clear and attractive
          format.

          contributed 30% to my final mark, and both of which I scored A grades in.

          Database Management Systems covered the design and implementation of databases,
          from the simple theory behind tables and fields to more complicated topics like
          security, indexing and permissions. We created a database for our coursework in a
          group of 5 people (using MySQL) for a fictional delivery company. This is explained
          in more detail on my <a href="../projects/all.html">University Projects</a> page.
          We also explored other types of database implementations such as object oriented, NoSQL and XML.

          In this course we were introduced to the C programming language and ARM Assembly language.
          The coursework for part 1 was to use C to encode secret messages inside the pixels of ppm
          images, and part 2 involved manipulating a raspbery pi, using a mix of C and ARM, to simulate
          a game which involved pressing buttons and flashing lights. Some of the theory in this module
          included the memory hierarchy, interrupt handling and processor architecture.

          This course focused on designing software that is highly usable and efficient.
          Software Design made us aware of the risks that exist when designing software and
          a number of ways to avoid these risks. We also learned a number of interesting
          design diagrams such as Use Case, Sequence, Activity and State-Machine diagrams.

          Comments: The jump between 1st and 2nd year was one I found challenging but one I did
          successfully overcome, I feel. With two subjects I found extremely challenging, Web Programming
          and Hardware-Software Interface taking place in year 2 I feel that this made prioritising and
          workload a lot harder but I was very happy with my grades in the end.
