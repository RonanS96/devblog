          This module introduced me to the mathematical concept of logic. This included predicate
          logic, including the truth tables of AND, OR, IMPLICATION, BI-IMPLICATION and NOT. And
          First-Order Logic.  We also covered areas such as parse trees, Boolean algebra, sets and
          Russell's Paradox.

          This module covered the creation of Android apps and was entirely coursework based.
          I built a currency converter and a game called Hit the Target using MIT App Inventor
          and Java/XML respectively.  The course focused on creating apps that were useful and
          attractive to use and look at.

          From the latin word meaning to practice, this course was all about introducing us to
          university working life.  We covered topics on presentation skills, working in groups,
          careers and report writing - including Harvard referencing.  The entire course grade was
          made up from 3 reports written on technology subjects which we had some choice over.

          As the first of 3 Software Development modules this course introduced us to
          the concept of object-oriented programming and in particular the programming
          language Java.  We covered objects/classes and types, variables, loops, basic
          data structures and some sorting algorithms.

          Intro to Computer Systems covered Computing at a much lower level than I had
          worked with before.  The course started off covering the history of computing
          but later topics discussed information representation and floating point binary
          values, processor design, operating systems, memory and virtual memory, and
          MIPS Assembly language.

          Software Development 2 covered some more complex areas of programming in Java,
          such as abstract classes, polymorphism, refacturing and inheritance.  Part 2
          of this module discussed graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java (using Java AWT
          and Swing libraries).

          This module taught us more complex data structures such as Stacks, Queues, Linked
          Lists and Trees, and algorithms for searching and sorting the data being stored in them.
          We also covered Big-Oh notation on this course which can be used to measure the efficiency
          of algorithms and compare them against each other.

          In this module we were introduced to creating websites using HTML and CSS. We were
          taught some theory about how people use websites and the way in which websites are
          changing (e.g responsive web design more important now).  We later started working on
          databases using MySQL and learned to create forms in websites which could communicate
          with the database through PHP.

          Comments: First semester of first year was a very successful start to university for me
          and one which I enjoyed.  The quick increase in workload in semester 2, with 3 courses
          that were highly practical, did have a negative impact on my grades but it helped me to
          develop my organisational skills.
