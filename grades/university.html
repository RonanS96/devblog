          This module introduced us to a number of exciting areas in AI. Namely, different types
          of agents; learning agents, biological agents, planning agents.  And how they actually
          work; heuristics, Markov Decision Processes, decision trees, and genetic algorithms.
          We also carried out <a href="../projects/all.html">coursework</a> on this course which
          made use of A* Search, a combination of 'Greedy Search' and Dijkstra's algorithm, and we
          worked with STRIPS - a form of PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) to simulate
          situations where a 'robot' would have to plan its movements based on a set of actions,
          objects and goals.

          This module was all about how computer systems in a network communicate. We were
          taught about different layers of abstraction; the application, transport, network,
          link and physical layers, and the different protocols that are in use at each level.
          Our coursework in this module involved running and editing a Java applet program
          that we had been provided which simulated 'packet switching' and we were to introduce
          a method called 'piggybacking' to improve the efficiency of the simulated protocol.

          Foundations 1 taught us all about the lambda calculus, a formal system in mathematical
          logic which describes computation.  We learned about the history of the lambda calculus
          and learned how to work with it using alpha, beta and eta reductions and subterms.
          We were tested on our knowledge half way through the semester with a class test and
          the coursework assignment involved writing an SML program which could translate between
          different types of lambda calculus language.

          This module was split half and half with our third year group project.  In Software
          Engineering we were taught about a number of topics that would assist us with our
          project.  Some of these topics include working in a team, version control (using GitHub),
          agile development and SCRUM, risk management, usability testing and project costing.

          In Foundations 2 we learned about 'computer science before computers'.  This covered
          some set theory; including enumeration of sets and countability, Cantor's diagonalization
          method for proving uncountabilty, Turing Machines and Godel Numbering of sets. There was
          a strong push on this course by our lecturer for us to learn and fully understand the

          Language Processors introduced us to the concept of formal grammars, and helped
          us to learn how these can be created.  We were taught about how ambiguity can effect
          the grammar, and we created some of our own using regular expressions.  We worked on
          labsheets which were to be handed in every few weeks and covered areas like Deterministic
          and Nondeterministic Finite Automata as well as Pushdown Automata.
          In part 2 of the course we learned about compilers and interpreters, and different stages
          of compilation such as lexical and syntax analysis and code generation.  For the coursework
          I built part of a recursive decsent parser which covered lexical and syntax analysis
          on a programming language we defined in class called 'FUNC'.

          In this class we learned about how application programs, system programs and hardware work together
          in the background when we are using a computer.  We covered a number of interesting topics including
          processes and threads, memory management, file systems, pipelining, data-flow and
          data-parallelism.

          The idea of professional development was to improve ourselves as professionals and prepare for the
          world of work in technology.  We discussed ethics, laws, standards, risks and threats (to your and/or
          the company you work for) and some history on how tech has affected society and what will happen in the future.
          For 10% of our mark for this course we were tasked with presenting to the class on a given topic.  Our topic
          was the following question: "What should a driverless car do when a pedestrian unlawfully walks out infront
          of it?" Our presentation slides can be viewed <a href="../projects/dcars.pdf">here</a> (pdf).

          Comments: I am very proud of myself for what I achieved in my third year. I feel that the extremely
          heavy workload, especially during semester 2, has helped me to develop my organisational and
          prioritising skills and I feel that at this stage I have a very broad range of knowledge in
          computer science. Next year I hope to specialise a bit more and I look forward to the challenge
          of fourth year.
